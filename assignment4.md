# Assignment 4 #

### Develop and write out your final story pitch. As part of your pitch, please include the following: ###

I plan to look at how many people successfully changed their gender marker to X in the District of Columbia (I may even look at transgender individuals). I think it would be interesting to track the steps that need to be taken in order to change your gender marker as well. I would also like to look at, if possible, race and age (which could add another narrative to the data altogether. 

**1.**	**What data source(s) you plan on using (though you can always add more later)**
To do this I plan on using the [National Center for Transgender Equality which is based in D.C.](https://transequality.org/documents/state/district-columbia) As well as the DC DMV ([DC DMV - Southwest Service Center](https://dmv.dc.gov/node/1099172)) – hopefully they have collected data that is usable. 

**2.**	**Some sources you can talk to about the data or to get anecdotes from it**
Hopefully I can talk to some people through the National Center for Transgender Equality as well as [The DC Center for the LGBT Community](http://thedccenter.org) and [SMYAL](https://smyal.org) (although they deal with youth, they still interact with those who identify outside of the gender binary spectrum). I think these places would have access to characters that could speak on this data as well as the process and even perhaps some of the challenges that come with changing your gender marker in D.C. 

**3.**	**What elements in the data might be good candidates to visualize**
I think some good candidates to visualize this data would be the number of successful gender marker changes, (possibly the number of unsuccessful changes and why), age, race and perhaps districts within D.C. or Maryland in terms of differing opportunity or access). 

**4.**	**What your news hook is - why is this timely? Why does this matter now?**
The news hook is the process of changing gender markers for gender non-conforming people and why it has to include so many steps (and who is affects in terms of access and opportunity). This is timely because as 11 states and counting continue to enact different laws and policies with regards to gender marker changing, non-binary and gender non-conforming people need to be considered. This matters now because the fight for gender equality for the LGBTQ+ community is being put on the frontlines and challenged every day. Trump is even trying to get rid of certain policies that guarantees transgender people medical insurance and transitional surgeries.

**5.**	**What question will you answer with your data, and why is it newsworthy?**
I will answer whether or not gender marking changing is affective and fair to LGBTQ+ people don’t identify on the gender binary. It is newsworthy because it deals with people who are constantly disenfranchised and told they don’t deserve certain rights because of how they identify.
