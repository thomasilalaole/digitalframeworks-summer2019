# STORY IDEAS #
 
## Story Idea 1 ##
My first story idea would explore the non-binary population in terms of [driver’s licenses](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/us/nonbinary-drivers-licenses.html). There are 11 states currently that allow a person to change their gender marker to the letter X instead of on the binary of gender described as male (M) or female (F). 
According to a study by university of california los angeles, in 2018 1.4 million adults in the U.S. identified as transgender. According to the [American Psychology Association](https://www.apadivisions.org/division-44/resources/advocacy/non-binary-facts.pdf), a quarter (aproximately 350,000) to a third (aproxitmately 466,666) of transgender people consider themselves non-binary. As the transgender movement gains traction, the non-binay and gender non-conforming population has slowly been added to the overall narrative. 
I would like explore the data related to the non-binary and gender non-conforming population, as well as what precentages has successfully changed their gender marker. This would lead to subsquent data of how many felt like they couldn’t change their gender marker for fear of discrimination and how many experienced descrimination because they changed their marker.

## Story Idea 2 ##
My second story idea would explore the non-binary population on colleges campuses. I recently read an article that talked about [Ithaca College](https://theithacan.org/news/nonbinary-students-missing-from-college-data/) collecting annual analytical data of their students called Facts in Brief. Amongst the many questions is obviously the gender of each student, but for non-binary students, their genders aren’t being considered in the final tally. According to the article, “the application, has a nonbinary gender option, but the college cannot report the number of nonbinary students it has publicly because of government funding regulations.”
I would like to explore the number of colleges that allow non-binary students to record their identities on official paperwork and documents, as well as colleges that do not allow this.

## Story Idea 3 ##
My third story idea would explore the LGBTQ+ African American population and the duality of discrimination that they face. In the United States there has obviously been a long history of discrimination of African American people, as well as LGBTQ+ people. But most Americans don’t know that being both African American and LGBTQ+ identifying opens up an entire new narrative of discrimination especially in the African American community. 
I would like to explore the data of African American LGBTQ+ people in terms of discrimination in society. I think it could also be interesting to explore data that perhaps has recorded this type of discrimination in work and professional spaces; possibly even school spaces.

## **Objective: Clarity and accuracy** ##
  * Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. **5**
    * What was it? **Data on LGBT African-Americans and African-American Same-sex Couples** 
    * Was it in the headline? **Yes**
  * Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent **5**
    * Was that the most efficient way to navigate? **Yes, you scroll through the data.** 
    * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? **Make it more interactive instead of just simple graphics.**
  * Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate **5**
    * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data. **None**
    * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. **None**
    * Did they provide a source? **Yes**
    * Did they explain everything that needed explaining? **Yes**

## **Objective: Quality** ##
  * Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.) **5**
    * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.
        * **They did well because their data is presented in multiple visual forms which adds variety and doesn’t allow the reader to become overwhelmed. Each piece of data also has a correspondent explanation which delves further into what the data means and its importance. I think the data should be interactive somehow, if it were presented on a website. I also feel that the ways in which the data is presented through graphs and diagrams is a bit predictable. I think some creativity could be used to present this data in a more relatable way.**
  * Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
    * Did this graphic accomplish all tasks? **Yes**
    * If not, which ones did it not accomplish **N/A**
  * Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)
    * Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose? **No**
    * For example, did it:
        * Look like it all belonged together? **Yes. There was definitely a color and typography theme that made the data and presentation cohesive.**
	      * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information? **Since everything is in a diagram or graph, it’s hard, at times, to determine what the most important piece is.**
        * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue? **I think because the article has data that spans many different questions, it would be hard to have it make sense in terms of color or typography (unless they were to use different colors for each set of data).**
  * Type (1-5) **4/5**
    * Explain: **The typography is clean and concise and doesn’t take away from the importance or relevance of the information or the correlating data.**
  * Color (1-5) **2/3**
    * Explain: **The color is just ok. Because there’s no variation when it comes to the different sets of data, the one note color sort of meshes everything together. I think if the article had a system of colors that corelated with each different set of data, it would have made it easier to follow and understand.**

## **Objective: Creativity** ##
  * Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you? **Not really creative. More so clean and predictable.**
    * How? **I think the use of different types of graphs is certainly creative, but I wouldn’t say it’s revolutionary by any means. I think it keeps it interesting in terms of variance, but I think the data could be presented in a more creative way, with perhaps pictures of people or scenes/situations that show what the data means, or even data that moves when interacted with.**
    * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5. **3/4**
